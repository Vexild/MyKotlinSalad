# myKotlinSalad
Kotlin app that includes all my kotlin projects done in Monialustainen Mobiiliohjelmointi 2019 -course
More activities will be added but the idea of this program is to act as a "collection app" for these activities.

### Weather Activity:

This activity includes use of https://openweathermap.org API for forecast information. Activity has fields for city name, temperature, humidity and weather status. It also includes a city search functionality.

### Live Cam Activity

Enjoy Korkeasaari's moongoose live cam! 

### GPS Location Activity

Has google map and SQLiteDataBase integrated. Search button uses the same api as th Weather Activity and locates the use in the map. Location is added to database and it loads onCreate() function. User can also longpress locations and they get added to the base too. If keeping data annoys the user it can all be wiped by Clear Database.
